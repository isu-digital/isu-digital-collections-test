## About the Iowa Ornithological Association Record Book
&nbsp;  
The Iowa Ornithological Association was organized in 1894 to 'promote more thorough study of the birds' of the state of Iowa. The collection consists of one notebook titled "Record Book of the Iowa Ornithologists' Association". The notebook contains minutes of the first through third annual congresses (1895-1897), a list of members, its constitution, news clippings, and correspondence.
