## Content Warning - World War II Artifacts:

Some of Lippisch's work is linked to World War II, reflecting his contributions to military projects in Nazi Germany. Therefore, some images in this collection include symbols of the Nazi German government which may be upsetting to some viewers. Viewers are advised to approach these pieces with historical awareness, recognizing the sensitivity of the subject.
